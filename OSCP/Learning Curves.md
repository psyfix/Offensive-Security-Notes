Always use more then one tool when you are stuck! eg. dirb, feroxbuster and ffuf.

Always google what you see when you are stuck. Whether that is the name of a directory or file / or a the name of string in the nmap response. Google it and put exploit afterwards.

Always try a recursive directory search with feroxbuster.
