### PLAN
###### Risk Assessment
Carry out risk assessment to identify broader scope of risk to the application. 
- This includes non-technical risks like compliance and business risks.
- Involves identifying assets, vulnerabilities, potential threats, and the likelihood and impact of these threats. It then assigns a risk level to each identified issue.
###### Threat Modelling
- To identify and analyze specific security threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in a system or application.
- Focuses specifically on security-related threats, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, etc.
- Involves identifying potential attackers, attack vectors, and the assets they might target. It also involves mapping out how these attacks could be carried out and the potential impact.
###### Security Design Review
- Carry out a full review of the design of the application.
- Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the design.
	- Covers areas: 
### CODE
###### Secure Coding Practices & Development Training
- Provide training and teaching about best practices and OWASP Top 10 and ASVS.
- Conduct secure code reviews.
###### Secrets Management
- Implement and ensure that secrets are being managed securely.
- Make sure developers are not hard coding secrets into code.
###### IDE Plugins
- Implement IDE plugins that can alert and notify developers during coding about security issues.
- Tool Examples: Synk, SonarLint
